== Performance comparison between Spring and Quarkus

Quarkus offers a big advantage in resource consumption compared to a Spring application. Especially in native mode, the memory footprint of a Quarkus application is extremely low, which can be a deciding factor in real-world environments.
The tables <<PerformanceComparisonApplication1>> and <<PerformanceComparisonApplication2>>, which show the startup and memory consumption of two applications that are similar in their Quarkus and Spring implementations, illustrate this point. Application 1 is more complex in scope than Application 2 and uses more dependencies.
The listings above the tables show the functions/extensions of the applications and the lines of code (only java files).

.**Application 1:**
* LOC (without automatically generated classes)
** Quarkus: ~4600
** Spring: ~7700 (separated into api and core module, as described for the link:guide-structure-classic.adoc[classic project structure]; api: ~3800, core: 3900)
* Features
** 3 entitites
** REST service
** Connection to a Postgres database (using Spring Data JPA and QueryDSL for the repository implementation)
** Flyway for database migration
** Kafka for asynchronous messaging
** Avro for data serialization combined with a schema registry
