== Creating a new application

== Running the archetype

In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the maven archetype functionality.

To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw IDE. Follow the devon ide documentation to install
the same.
You can choose between 2 alternatives, create it from command line or, in more visual manner, within eclipse.

=== From command Line
To create a new devon4j application from command line, you can simply run the following command:

[source,bash]
---- 
devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp
---- 

For low-level creation you can also manually call this command: 

[source,bash]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=${devon4j.version} -DarchetypeGroupId=com.devonfw.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=devon4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.application -DartifactId=sampleapp -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.devonfw.application.sampleapp 
---- 

Attention: The `archetypeVersion` (first argument) should be set to the latest version of `devon4j`. You can easily determine the version from this badge:

Further providing additional properties (using `-D` parameter) you can customize the generated app:

.Options for app template
[options="header"]
|=======================
|*property*      |*comment*                                                                                           |*example*
|`dbType`        |Choose the type of RDBMS to use (`hana`, `oracle`, `mssql`, `postgresql`, `mariadb`, `mysql`, etc.) |`-DdbTpye=postgresql`
|`batch`         |Option to add an `batch` module                                                                     |`-Dbatch=batch`
|=======================

=== From Eclipse
 After that, you should follow this Eclipse steps to create your application:

* Create a new Maven Project.
* Choose the devon4j-template-server archetype, just like the image.

* Fill the Group Id, Artifact Id, Version and Package for your project.

* Finish the Eclipse assistant and you are ready to start your project.

== What is generated

The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:

* `api`: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transferobjects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.
* `core`: maven module containing the core of the application.
* `batch`: optional module for xref:guide-batch-layer.adoc[batch](es)
* `server`: module that bundles the entire app (`core` with optional `batch`) as a WAR file.

The toplevel `pom.xml` of the generated project has the following features:

* Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.
* Modules definition for the modules (described above)
* Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.
* Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration
* Profiles for xref:guide-testing.adoc[test stages]

== How to run your app

=== Run app from IDE

To run your application from your favourite IDE, simply launch `SpringBootApp` as java application.

=== Run app as bootified jar or war

More details are available xref:guide-structure.adoc#make-jar-not-war[here].
