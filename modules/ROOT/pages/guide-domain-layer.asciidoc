= Domain Layer

The domain layer is responsible for the data-model and mapping this to a https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide/blob/master/general/db/guide-database.asciidoc[database]. 
The most common approach is to use a Relational Database Management System (RDMS). In such a case, we strongly recommend to follow our link:guide-jpa.asciidoc[JPA Guide]. Some NoSQL databases are supported by https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[spring-data] so you can consider the link:guide-repository.asciidoc[repository guide].

Note: The domain layer is the replacement for the link:guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc[data-access layer] in the link:guide-structure-modern.asciidoc[modern project structure].
