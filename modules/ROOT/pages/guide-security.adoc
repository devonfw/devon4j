== Security
//Fixed Typo
Security is todays most important cross-cutting concern of an application and an enterprise IT-landscape. We seriously care about security and give you detailed guides to prevent pitfalls, vulnerabilities, and other disasters. While many mistakes can be avoided by following our guidelines you still have to consider security and think about it in your design and implementation. The security guide will not only automatically prevent you from any harm, but will provide you hints and best practices already used in different software products.

An important aspect of security is proper authentication and authorization as described in xref:guide-access-control.adoc[access-control]. In the following we discuss about potential vulnerabilities and protection to prevent them.

== Vulnerabilities and Protection
Independent from classical authentication and authorization mechanisms there are many common pitfalls that can lead to vulnerabilities and security issues in your application such as XSS, CSRF, SQL-injection, log-forging, etc. A good source of information about this is the https://www.owasp.org[OWASP].
We address these common threats individually in _security_ sections of our technological guides as a concrete solution to prevent an attack typically depends on the according technology. The following table illustrates common threats and contains links to the solutions and protection-mechanisms provided by the devonfw:

== Advanced Security

While OWASP Top 10 covers the basic aspects of application security, there are advanced standards such as `AVS`.
In devonfw we address this in the https://github.com/devonfw/security/wiki[
Application Security Quick Solution Guide].

== Tools
=== Dependency Check
To address the thread `Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities` we recomment to use https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check[OWASP dependency check] that ships with a maven plugin and can analyze your dependencies for known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures[CVE]s.
In order to run this check, you can simply call this command on any maven project:
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:6.1.5:aggregate
---- 

NOTE: The version is just for completeness. You should check yourself for using a recent version of the plugin.

If you build an devon4j spring application from our xref:tutorial-newapp.adoc[app-template] you can activate the dependency check even easier with the `security` profile:
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn clean install -P security
---- 
This does not run by default as it causes some overhead for the build performance. However, consider to build this in your CI at least nightly.
After the dependency check is performed, you will find the results in `target/dependency-check-report.html` of each module. The report will also be generated when the site is build (`mvn site`) even without the profile.

=== Penetration Testing
For penetration testing (testing for vulnerabilities) of your web application, we recommend the following tools:

* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project[ZAP] (OWASP Zed Attack Proxy Project)
* http://sqlmap.org/[sqlmap] (or https://github.com/PaulSec/HQLmap[HQLmap])
* https://nmap.org/[nmap]
* See the marvelous presentation https://jaxenter.com/security-open-source-toolbox-video-151314.html[Toolbox of a security professional] from https://www.Christian-Schneider.net[Christian Schneider].
