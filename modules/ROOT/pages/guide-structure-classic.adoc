== Classic project structure

In this section we describe the classic project structure as initially proposed for Java in devonfw.
It is still valid and fully supported.
However, if you want to start a new project, please consider using the link:guide-structure-modern.adoc[modern structure].

== Modules

The structure of a `devon4j` application is divided into the following modules:

* `api`: module containing the API of your application. The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be link:guide-rest.adoc#jax-rs[REST service interfaces], link:guide-transferobject.adoc[transfer-objects] with their interfaces and link:guide-datatype.adoc[datatypes] but also https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI] or https://grpc.io/[gRPC] contracts.
* `core`: maven module containing the core of the application with service implementation, as well as entire link:guide-logic-layer.adoc[logic layer] and link:guide-dataaccess-layer.adoc[dataaccess layer].
* `batch`: optional module for link:guide-batch-layer.adoc[batch layer]
* `server`: module that bundles the entire app (`core` with optional `batch`) typically as a bootified WAR file.

== Deployment

[quote, Josh Long]

Make jar not war
____

First of all it is important to understand that the above defined modules aim to make `api`, `core`, and `batch` reusable artifacts, that can be used as a regular maven dependency.
On the other hand to build and deploy your application you want a final artifact that is containing all required 3rd party libraries.
This artifact is not reusable as a maven dependency.
That is exactly the purpose of the `server` module to build and package this final deployment artifact.
By default we first build a regular `WAR` file with maven in your `server/target` directory (`\*-server-«version».war`) and in a second step create a bootified `WAR` out of this (`*-server-bootified.war`).
The bootified `WAR` file can then be started standalone (`java -jar «filename».war`).
However, it is also possible to deploy the same `WAR` file to a servlet container like `tomcat` or `jetty`.
As application servers and externally provided servlet containers are not recommendet anymore for various reasons (see link:guide-jee.adoc[JEE]), you may also want to create a bootified `JAR` file instead.
All you need to do in that case is to change the `packaging` in your `server/pom.xml` from `war` to `jar`. 

== Package Structure

The package structure of your code inside `src/main/java` (and `src/test/java`) of your modules is described in our coding conventions in the sections link:coding-conventions.adoc#packages[packages]. A full mapping of the architecture and the different code elements to the packaging is described in the following section.

== Layers

The package structure of your code inside `src/main/java` (and `src/test/java`) of your app is described in our coding conventions in the sections link:coding-conventions.adoc#packages[packages].
The following table describes our classic approach for packaging and layering:

.Traditional generic devon4j layers
[options="header"]
|=============================================
|*Layer* | *«layer»*
|link:guide-service-layer.adoc[service]|`service`
|link:guide-logic-layer.adoc[logic]|`logic`
|link:guide-dataaccess-layer.adoc[data-access]|`dataaccess`
|link:guide-batch-layer.adoc[batch] (optional)|`batch`
|link:guide-client-layer.adoc[client] (optional)|`client`
|link:guide-common.adoc[common]|`common`
|=============================================

== Architecture Mapping

In order to help you to map the architecture, packaging, layering, etc. to the code and see where different code elements should be placed,
we provide this architecture mapping:
