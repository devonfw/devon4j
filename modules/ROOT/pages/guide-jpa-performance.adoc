== JPA Performance
When using JPA the developer sometimes does not see or understand where and when statements to the database are triggered.

So in case you do not understand what is going on under the hood of JPA, you will easily run into performance issues due to lazy loading and other effects.

== N plus 1 Problem
The most prominent phenomena is call the `N+1 Problem`.
We use entities from our https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star[MTS] demo app as an example to explain the problem.
There is a https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/blob/develop/java/mtsj/core/src/main/java/com/devonfw/application/mtsj/dishmanagement/dataaccess/api/DishEntity.java[DishEntity] that has a `@ManyToMany` relation to
https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/blob/develop/java/mtsj/core/src/main/java/com/devonfw/application/mtsj/dishmanagement/dataaccess/api/IngredientEntity.java[IngredientEntity].
Now we assume that we want to iterate all ingredients for a dish like this:
[source,java]
----
DishEntity dish = dao.findDishById(dishId);
BigDecimal priceWithAllExtras = dish.getPrice();
for (IngredientEntity ingredient : dish.getExtras()) {
  priceWithAllExtras = priceWithAllExtras.add(ingredient.getPrice());
}
----

Now `dish.getExtras()` is loaded lazy. Therefore the JPA vendor will provide a list with lazy initialized instances of `IngredientEntity` that only contain the ID of that entity. Now with every call of `ingredient.getPrice()` we technically trigger an SQL query statement to load the specific `IngredientEntity` by its ID from the database.
Now `findDishById` caused 1 initial query statement and for any number `N` of ingredients we are causing an additional query statement. This makes a total of `N+1` statements. As causing statements to the database is an expensive operation with a lot of overhead (creating connection, etc.) this ends in bad performance and is therefore a problem (the N+1 Problem).

== Solving N plus 1 Problem
To solve the N+1 Problem you need to change your code to only trigger a single statement instead. This can be archived in various ways. The most universal solution is to use `FETCH JOIN` in order to pre-load the nested `N` child entities into the first level cache of the JPA vendor implementation. This will behave very similar as if the `@ManyToMany` relation to `IngredientEntity` was having `FetchType.EAGER` but only for the specific query and not in general. Because changing `@ManyToMany` to `FetchType.EAGER` would cause bad performance for other usecases where only the dish but not its extra ingredients are needed. For this reason all relations, including `@OneToOne` should always be `FetchType.LAZY`. Back to our example we simply replace `dao.findDishById(dishId)` with `dao.findDishWithExtrasById(dishId)` that we implement by the following JPQL query:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT dish FROM DishEntity dish 
  LEFT JOIN FETCH dish.extras 
  WHERE dish.id = :dishId
----
The rest of the code does not have to be changed but now `dish.getExtras()` will get the `IngredientEntity` from the first level cache where is was fetched by the initial query above.

Please note that if you only need the sum of the prices from the extras you can also create a query using an aggregator function:
----
SELECT sum(dish.extras.price) FROM DishEntity dish 
----
As you can see you need to understand the concepts in order to get good performance. 

There are many advanced topics such as creating database indexes or calculating statistics for the query optimizer to get the best performance. For such advanced topics we recommend to have a database expert in your team that cares about such things. However, understanding the _N+1 Problem_ and its solutions is something that every Java developer in the team needs to understand.
