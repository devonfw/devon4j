= Java Development Kit

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit[Java Development Kit] is an implementation of the Java platform. It provides the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine[Java Virtual Machine] (JVM) and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

== Editions

The JDK exists in different editions:

* https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK] is a free and open-source edition of the JDK.
* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html[OracleJDK] is a commercial edition of the JDK.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines[Various alternative JDK editions] either commercial (e.g. IBM's JVM) or open-source.

As Java is evolving and also complex maintaining a JVM requires a lot of energy.
Therefore many alternative JDK editions are unable to cope with this and support latest Java versions and according compatibility.
Unfortunately OpenJDK only maintains a specific version of Java for a relative short period of time before moving to the next major version.
In the end, this technically means that OpenJDK is continuous beta and can not be used in production for reasonable software projects.
As OracleJDK changed its licensing model and can not be used for commercial usage even during development, things can get tricky.
You may want to use OpenJDK for development and OracleJDK only in production.
However, e.g. OpenJDK 11 never released a version that is stable enough for reasonable development (e.g. javadoc tool is https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212233[broken] and fixes are not available of OpenJDK 11 - fixed in 11.0.3 what is only available as OracleJDK 11 or you need to go to OpenJDK 12+, what has other bugs) so in the end there is no working release of OpenJDK 11.
This more or less forces you to use OracleJDK what requires you to buy a subscription so you can use it for commercial development.
However, there is https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK[AdoptOpenJDK] that provides forked releases of OpenJDK with bug-fixes what might be an option.
Anyhow, as you want to have your development environment close to production, the productively used JDK (most likely OracleJDK) should be preferred also for development.

== Upgrading

Until Java 8 compatibility was one of the key aspects for Java version updates (after the mess on the Swing updates with Java2 many years ago).
However, Java 9 introduced a lot of breaking changes.
This documentation wants to share the experience we collected in devonfw when upgrading from Java 8 to newer versions.
First of all we separate runtime changes that you need if you want to build your software with JDK 8 but such that it can also run on newer versions (e.g. JRE 11)
from changes required to also build your software with more recent JDKs (e.g. JDK 11 or 12).

=== Runtime Changes
This section describes required changes to your software in order to make it run also with versions newer than Java 8.

==== Classes removed from JDK
The first thing that most users hit when running their software with newer Java versions is a `ClassNotFoundException` like this:
```
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.bind.JAXBException
```
As Java 9 introduced a module system with https://www.baeldung.com/project-jigsaw-java-modularity[Jigsaw], the JDK that has been a monolithic mess is now a well-defined set of structured modules.
Some of the classes that used to come with the JDK moved to modules that where not available by default in Java 9 and have even been removed entirely in later versions of Java.
Therefore you should simply treat such code just like any other 3rd party component that you can add as a (maven) dependency.
The following table gives you the required hints to make your software work even with such classes / modules removed from the JDK (please note that the specified version is just a suggestion that worked, feel free to pick a more recent or more appropriate version):

.Dependencies for classes removed from Java 8 since 9+
[options="header"]
|=============================================
|*Class*              |*GroupId*           |*ArtifactId*           |*Version*
|`javax.xml.bind.*`   |`javax.xml.bind`    |`jaxb-api`             |`2.3.1`
|`com.sun.xml.bind.*` |`org.glassfish.jaxb`|`jaxb-runtime`         |`2.3.1`
|`java.activation.*`  |`javax.activation`  |`javax.activation-api` |`1.2.0`
|`java.transaction.*` |`javax.transaction` |`javax.transaction-api`|`1.2`
|`java.xml.ws.*`      |`javax.xml.ws`      |`jaxws-api`            |`2.3.1`
|`javax.jws.*`        |`javax.jws`         |`javax.jws-api`        |`1.1`
|`javax.annotation.*` |`javax.annotation`  |`javax.annotation-api` |`1.3.2`
|=============================================

==== 3rd Party Updates
Further, internal and inofficial APIs (e.g. `sun.misc.Unsafe`) have been removed.
These are typically not used by your software directly but by low-level 3rd party libraries like `asm` that need to be updated.
Also simple things like the Java version have changed (from `1.8.x` to `9.x`, `10.x`, `11.x`, `12.x`, etc.).
Some 3rd party libraries were parsing the Java version in a very naive way making them unable to be used with Java 9+:
```
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
   at org.apache.maven.surefire.shade.org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.isJavaVersionAtLeast (SystemUtils.java:1626)
```
Therefore the following table gives an overview of common 3rd party libraries that have been affected by such breaking changes and need to be updated to at least the specified version:

|*GroupId* |*ArtifactId* |*Version*|*Issue*
|`org.apache.commons`|`commons-lang3`|`3.7`|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-1365[LANG-1365]

|=============================================

==== ResourceBundles
For internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) `ResourceBundle` is used for language and country specific texts and configurations as properties (e.g. `MyResourceBundle_de.properties`). With Java modules there are changes and impacts you need to know to get things working. The most important change is documented in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html#bundleprovider[JavaDoc of ResourceBundle]. However, instead of using https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/spi/ResourceBundleProvider.html[ResourceBundleProvider] and refactoring your entire code causing incompatibilities, you can simply put the resource bundles in a regular JAR on the classpath rather than a named module (or into the lauching app).
If you want to implement (new) Java modules with i18n support, you can have a look at https://github.com/m-m-m/nls#mmm-nls[mmm-nls].

=== Buildtime Changes
If you also want to change your build to work with a recent JDK you also need to ensure that test frameworks and maven plugins properly support this.

==== Findbugs
Findbugs does not work with Java 9+ and is actually a dead project.
The new findbugs is https://spotbugs.github.io/[SpotBugs].
For maven the new solution is https://spotbugs.github.io/spotbugs-maven-plugin/[spotbugs-maven-plugin]:
```
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.spotbugs</groupId>
  <artifactId>spotbugs-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.11</version>
</plugin>
```

|`org.jacoco`|`jacoco-maven-plugin`|`0.8.3`|https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/663[663]
|=============================================

==== Maven Usage

With Java modules you can not run Javadoc standalone anymore or you will get this error when running `mvn javadoc:javadoc`:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin:3.1.1:javadoc (default-cli) on project mmm-base: An error has occurred in Javadoc report generation:
[ERROR] Exit code: 1 - error: module not found: io.github.mmm.base
[ERROR]
[ERROR] Command line was: /projects/mmm/software/java/bin/javadoc @options @packages @argfile
```

As a solution or workaround you need to include the `compile` goal into your build lifecycle so the module-path is properly configured:
```
mvn compile javadoc:javadoc
```
