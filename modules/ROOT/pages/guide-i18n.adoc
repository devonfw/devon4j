= Internationalization
//The property file doesn't exist anymore but the example looks fine. Keep it? 
Internationalization (I18N) is about writing code independent from locale-specific information.
For I18N of text messages we are suggesting 
http://m-m-m.sourceforge.net/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/util/nls/api/package-summary.html#documentation[mmm native-language-support].

In devonfw we have developed a solution to manage text internationalization. devonfw solution comes into two aspects:

* Bind locale information to the user. 

* Get the messages in the current user locale.

== Binding locale information to the user

We have defined two different points to bind locale information to user, depending on user is authenticated or not.

* User not authenticated: devonfw intercepts unsecured request and extract locale from it. At first, we try to extract a `language` parameter from the request and if it is not possible, we extract locale from Ã€ccept-language` header. 

* User authenticated. During login process, applications developers are responsible to fill `language` parameter in the UserProfile class. This `language` parameter could be obtain from DB, LDAP, request, etc. In devonfw sample we get the locale information from database.

This image shows the entire process:

== Getting internationalizated messages

devonfw has a bean that manage i18n message resolution, the `ApplicationLocaleResolver.` This bean is responsible to get the current user and extract locale information from it and read the correct properties file to get the message.

The i18n properties file must be called `ApplicationMessages_la_CO.properties` where la=language and CO=country. This is an example of a i18n properties file for English language to translate devonfw sample user roles:

ApplicationMessages_en_US.properties
[source]
----
admin=Admin
----

You should define an ApplicationMessages_la_CO.properties file for every language that your application needs.

`ApplicationLocaleResolver` bean is injected in `AbstractComponentFacade` class so you have available this bean in logic layer so you only need to put this code to get an internationalized message:

[source,java]
----
String msg = getApplicationLocaleResolver().getMessage("mymessage");
----
