== ETO and CTO approach

== ETO
For each link:guide-jpa.adoc#entity[persistent entity] `«BusinessObject»Entity` we create or generate a corresponding _entity transfer object_ (ETO) named `«BusinessObject»Eto`. It has the same properties except for relations.

== BO
In order to centralize the properties (getters and setters with their javadoc) we create a common interface `«BusinessObject»` implemented both by the entity and its ETO. This also gives us compile-time safety that
link:guide-beanmapping.adoc[bean-mapper] can properly map all properties between entity and ETO.

== CTO
If we need to pass an entity with its relation(s) we create a corresponding _composite transfer object_ (CTO) named `«BusinessObject»«Subset»Cto` that only contains other transfer-objects or collections of them. Here `«Subset»` is empty for the canonical CTO that holds the ETO together with all its relations.
This is what can be generated automatically with https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen[CobiGen].
However, be careful to generate CTOs without thinking and considering design.
If there are no relations at all a CTO is pointless and shall be omitted.
However, if there are multiple relations you typically need  multiple CTOs for the same `«BusinessObject»` that define different subsets of the related data.
These will typically be designed and implemented by hand.
E.g. you may have `CustomerWithAddressCto` and `CustomerWithContractCto`. Most CTOs correspond to a specific `«BusinessObject»` and therefore contain a `«BusinessObject»Eto`. Such CTOs should inherit from `MasterCto`.

This pattern with entities, ETOs and CTOs is illustrated by the following UML diagram from our sample application.
