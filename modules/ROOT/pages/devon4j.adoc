http://www.devonfw.com/[_devonfw_] provides a solution to building applications which combine best-in-class frameworks and libraries as well as industry proven practices and code conventions.
It massively speeds up development, reduces risks and helps you to deliver better results.

The following sections contain the complete compendium of https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/[devon4j], the Java stack of devonfw.
With devon4j we support both link:spring.adoc[spring] and link:quarkus.adoc[quarkus] as major frameworks.
However, the general coding patterns are based on common Java standards mainly from https://jakarta.ee[Jakarta EE] and therefore do not differ between those frameworks.
Therefore, the xref:general[general] section contains all the documentation that is universal to Java and does not differ between the two frameworks.
Only the sections link:spring.adoc[spring] and link:quarkus.adoc[quarkus] contain documentation that is specific to the respective approach.

You can also read the latest version of this documentation online at the following sources:
