== Quarkus template

https://code.quarkus.io/?g=org.devonfw&e=resteasy&e=resteasy-jackson&e=hibernate-validator&e=hibernate-orm&e=micrometer[Quarkus Code Generator] is providing a lot of alternatives on technologies and libraries to be integrated. Detailed guides to multiple topics can be found https://quarkus.io/guides/[here].

Thus, the large selection can be difficult for developer to get started.
Therefore, in this guide, we aims to provide a general suggestion on basic frameworks, libraries, technologies to make it easy for developer to begin with.

With that said, please take this as a recommendation and not a compulsion. Depend on your project requirements, you might have to use another stack in comparison to what is listed below.

If you are new to Quarkus, consider checking out their https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started[getting started guide] to have an overview about how to create, run, test as well as package a Quarkus application. Another recommended source to get started is https://www.katacoda.com/openshift/courses/developing-with-quarkus/getting-started[the Katacoda tutorials].
