== Building a native image

Quarkus provides the ability to create a native executable of the application called _https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image[native image]_.
Unlike other Java based deployments such native image will only run on the architecture and operating system it is compiled for.
Also, no JVM is needed to run the native-image.
This improves the startup time, performance and efficiency.
A distribution of https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] is needed.
You can find the differences between the available distributions https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#graalvm[here].

To build your quarkus app as native-image you have two options that are descibed in the following sections.

== Build a native executable with GraalVM

To build a Quarkus application you can install GraalVM locally on your machine as described below.
Therefore read the link:quarkus-template.adoc#basic-templates[basic Quarkus application chapter], or clone the https://github.com/devonfw-sample/devon4quarkus-reference[example project] provided by devonfw. 
Follow this https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#producing-a-native-executable[chapter] from the Quarkus Guide for building a native executable.

=== Installing GraalVM

A native image can be created locally or through a container environment.
To create a native image locally an installed and configured version of GraalVM is needed, you can follow the https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#prerequisites-for-oracle-graalvm-ceee[installation guide from Quarkus] or the https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#install-graalvm[guide provided by GraalVM] for this. 

== Build a native executable with GraalVM through container environment

In order to make the build of native images more portable, you can also use your container environment and run the GraalVM inside a container (typically Docker).
You can simply install Docker with your devonfw-ide distribution just follow this description https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/docker.adoc[Docker with devonfw-ide].
Follow this https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#container-runtime[chapter] to build a native Linux image through container runtime.

== Configuring the native executable 

A list of all configuration properties for a native image can be found https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#configuration-reference[here].
