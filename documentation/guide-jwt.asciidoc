= JSON Web Token(JWT)

https://jwt.io/[JWT] is an open standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC 7519]) for creating Json based access token that assert some number of claims.

== Keystore

A KeyStore is a repository of certificates and keys (public key, private key, or secret key). They can be used for TSL transportation, for encryption and decryption as well as for signing.


== Dependency

To use JWT support from devon4j you have to add following required dependency.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>
  <artifactId>devon4j-starter-security-jwt</artifactId>
</dependency> 
----

== Configuration

The following properties need to be configured in your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
# location of the keystore file, can be any spring resource (such as file or classpath URIs)
security.keystore.location=classpath:config/keystore.pkcs
# type of keystore e.g. "PKCS12" (recommended), "JKS", or "JCEKS"
security.keystore.type=PKCS12
# password the keystore is secured with. Consider using password encryption as described in devon4j configuration guide
security.keystore.password=password
# the algorithm for encryption/decryption and signing - see io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureAlgorithm
security.authentication.jwt.algorithm=RS256
# alias of public/private key in keystore (for validation only public key is used, for creation private key is required)
security.authentication.jwt.alias=devonfw
# the following properties are used if you are validating JWTs (e.g. via JwtAuthenticationFilter)
security.authentication.jwt.validation.expiration-required=false
security.authentication.jwt.validation.max-validity=42h
security.authentication.jwt.validation.not-before-required=false
# the following properties are only used if you are issuing JWTs (e.g. via JwtLoginFilter)
security.authentication.jwt.creation.add-issued-at=true
security.authentication.jwt.creation.validity=4h
security.authentication.jwt.creation.not-before-delay=1m

== Authentication with JWT via OAuth

The authentication with JWT via OAuth (HTTP header), will happen via `JwtAuthenticationFilter` that is automatically added by `devon4j-starter-security-jwt` via `JwtAutoConfiguration`.
With the starter and auto-configuration we want to make it as easy as possible for you 
In case you would like to build a server app that e.g. wants to issue JWTs but does not allow authentication via JWT itself, you can use `devon4j-security-jwt` instead of the starter and do the spring config yourself (pick and choose from `JwtAutoConfiguration`).

To do this, you need to add the following changes in your `BaseWebSecurityConfig`:

[source,java]
----
  @Bean
  public JwtAuthenticationFilter getJwtAuthenticationFilter() {
    return new JwtAuthenticationFilter();
  }
  
  @Override
  public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    // ...
    // add this line to the end of this existing method
    http.addFilterBefore(getJwtAuthenticationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
  }
----

== Login with Username and Password to get JWT

To allow a client to login with username and password to get a JWT for sub-sequent requests, you need to do the following changes in your `BaseWebSecurityConfig`:

[source,java]
----
  
  @Bean
  public JwtLoginFilter getJwtLoginFilter() throws Exception {

    JwtLoginFilter jwtLoginFilter = new JwtLoginFilter("/login");
    jwtLoginFilter.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager());
    jwtLoginFilter.setUserDetailsService(this.userDetailsService);
    return jwtLoginFilter;
  }
  
  @Override
  public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    // ...
    // add this line to the end of this existing method
    http.addFilterBefore(getJwtLoginFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
  }
