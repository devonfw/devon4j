= Bean-Mapping

For decoupling you sometimes need to create separate objects (beans) for a different view. E.g. for an external service you will use a link:guide-transferobject.asciidoc[transfer-object] instead of the link:guide-jpa.asciidoc#entity[persistence entity] so internal changes to the entity do not implicitly change or break the service. 

Therefore you have the need to map similar objects what creates a copy. This also has the benefit that modifications to the copy have no side-effect on the original source object. However, to implement such mapping code by hand is very tedious and error-prone (if new properties are added to beans but not to mapping code):
//Just the example adjusted to our MTSJ
[source,java]
----
public UserEto mapUser(UserEntity source) {
  UserEto target = new UserEto();
  target.setUsername(source.getUsername());
  target.setEmail(source.getEmail());
  ...
  return target;
}
----

Therefore we are using a `BeanMapper` for this purpose that makes our lives a lot easier.

== Bean-Mapper Dependency
To get access to the `BeanMapper` we use this dependency in our POM:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.devonfw.java</groupId>
      <artifactId>devon4j-beanmapping</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----
== Bean-Mapper Configuration
The `BeanMapper` implementation is based on an existing open-source bean mapping framework. 
In case of Dozer the mapping is configured `src/main/resources/config/app/common/dozer-mapping.xml`.

See the my-thai-star https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/blob/develop/java/mtsj/core/src/main/resources/config/app/common/dozer-mapping.xml[dozer-mapping.xml] as an example.
Important is that you configure all your custom datatypes as `<copy-by-reference>` tags and have the mapping from `PersistenceEntity` (`ApplicationPersistenceEntity`) to `AbstractEto` configured properly:
[source,xml]
----
 <mapping type="one-way">
    <class-a>com.devonfw.module.basic.common.api.entity.PersistenceEntity</class-a>
    <class-b>com.devonfw.module.basic.common.api.to.AbstractEto</class-b>
    <field custom-converter="com.devonfw.module.beanmapping.common.impl.dozer.IdentityConverter">
      <a>this</a>
      <b is-accessible="true">persistentEntity</b>
    </field>
</mapping>
----

== Bean-Mapper Usage
Then we can get the `BeanMapper` via link:guide-dependency-injection.asciidoc[dependency-injection] what we typically already provide by an abstract base class (e.g. `AbstractUc`). Now we can solve our problem very easy:

[source,java]
----
...
UserEntity resultEntity = ...;
...
return getBeanMapper().map(resultEntity, UserEto.class);
----

There is also additional support for mapping entire collections.
