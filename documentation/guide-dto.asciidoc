= DTO approach

WARNING: Hey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won't be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page https://devonfw.com/docs/java/current/[here].

As described in link:guide-structure-modern.asciidoc[our modern structure guide], for application e.g. with microservices architecture where we build smaller applications compared to monoliths, we recommend keeping things as simple as possible. The same principle applies to transfer object. Instead of using different types of transfer objects for each entity such as link:guide-eto-cto.asciidoc[ETO and CTO], we highly suggest using one _data transfer object_ (DTO) named `«BusinessObject»Dto`.
