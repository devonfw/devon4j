= Cassandra

This section is the place to share experience for those who use https://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] as link:guide-database.asciidoc#nosql[NoSQL database].

== Attention
NOTE: In devonfw we do not properly support this. You are free to use this database but do not expect advanced integration, CobiGen templates, etc.

== Driver
Please be aware that there is not a regular JDBC driver in case you are using Java (devon4j).
For driver options see https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/drivers.html[here].

== Spring-Data
There is spring-data support available for cassandra via https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-cassandra[spring-data-cassandra].

NOTE: Please note that some time ago we had feedback from projects that had issues with spring-data-cassandra and switched back to using the driver natively. We assume the issues are meanwhile resolved. TODO: collect more feedback and update this guide.
