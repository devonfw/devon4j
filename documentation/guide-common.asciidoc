WARNING: Hey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won't be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page https://devonfw.com/docs/java/current/[here].

In our link:coding-conventions.asciidoc[coding-conventions] we define a clear link:coding-conventions.asciidoc#packages[packaging] and link:coding-conventions.asciidoc#layers[layering].
However, there is always cross-cutting code that does not belong to a specific layer such as generic helpers, general code for configuration or integration, etc.
Therefore, we define a package segment `common` that can be used as `«layer»` for such cross-cutting code.
Code from any other layer is allowed to access such `common` code (at least within the same component).
