= UseCase
A use-case is a small unit of the link:guide-logic-layer.asciidoc[logic layer] responsible for an operation on a particular link:guide-jpa.asciidoc#entity[entity] (business object).
It is defined by an interface (API) with its according implementation.
Following our link:coding-conventions.asciidoc#architecture-mapping[architecture-mapping], use-cases are named `Uc«Operation»«BusinessObject»[Impl]`. The prefix `Uc` stands for use-case and allows to easily find and identify them in your IDE. The `«Operation»` stands for a verb that is operated on the entity identified by `«BusinessObject»`.
For https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete[CRUD] we use the standard operations `Find` and `Manage` that can be generated by https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen[CobiGen]. This also separates read and write operations (e.g. if you want to do CQSR, or to configure read-only transactions for read operations).

== Find
The `UcFind«BusinessObject»` defines all read operations to retrieve and search the `«BusinessObject»`.
Here is an example:
[source,java]
----
public interface UcFindBooking {

  BookingEto findBooking(Long id);

  BookingCto findBookingCto(Long id);

  Page<BookingEto> findBookingEtos(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria);

  Page<BookingCto> findBookingCtos(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria);

}
----

== Manage
The `UcManage«BusinessObject»` defines all CRUD write operations (create, update and delete) for the `«BusinessObject»`.
Here is an example:
[source,java]
----
public interface UcManageBooking {

  BookingEto saveBooking(BookingEto booking);

  boolean deleteBooking(Long id);

}
----

== Custom
Any other non CRUD operation `Uc«Operation»«BusinessObject»` uses any other custom verb for `«Operation»`.
Typically, such custom use-cases only define a single method.
Here is an example:
[source,java]
----
public interface UcApproveBooking {

  void approveBooking(BookingEto booking);

}
----

== Implementation
For the implementation of a use-cas, the same rules that are described for the link:guide-component-facade.asciidoc#implementation[component-facade implementation].

 .

However, when following the use-case approach, your component facade simply changes to:

[source,java]
----
public interface Bookingmanagement extends UcFindBooking, UcManageBooking, UcApproveBooking {
}
----

Where the implementation only delegates to the use-cases and gets entirely generated by CobiGen:

[source,java]
----
public class BookingmanagementImpl implements  {

  @Inject
  private UcFindBooking ucFindBooking;

  @Inject
  private UcManageBooking ucManageBooking;

  @Inject
  private UcApproveBooking ucApproveBooking;

  @Override
  public BookingEto findBooking(Long id) {
    return this.ucFindBooking.findBooking(id);
  }

  @Override
  public Page<BookingEto> findBookingEtos(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {
    return this.ucFindBooking.findBookingEtos(criteria);
  }

  @Override
  public BookingEto saveBooking(BookingEto booking) {
    return this.ucManageBooking.saveBooking(booking);
  }

  @Override
  public boolean deleteBooking(Long id) {
    return this.ucManageBooking.deleteBooking(booking);
  }

  @Override
  public void approveBooking(BookingEto booking) {
    this.ucApproveBooking.approveBooking(booking);
  }

  ...
}
----

This approach is also illustrated by the following UML diagram:

== Internal use case
Sometimes, a component with multiple related entities and many use-cases needs to reuse business logic internally.
Of course, this can be exposed as an official use-case API but this will imply using transfer-objects (ETOs) instead of entities. In some cases, this is undesired e.g. for better performance to prevent unnecessary mapping of entire collections of entities.
In the first place, you should try to use abstract base implementations providing reusable methods the actual use-case implementations can inherit from.
If your business logic is even more complex and you have multiple aspects of business logic to share and reuse but also run into multi-inheritance issues, you may also just create use-cases that have their interface located in the `impl` scope package right next to the implementation (or you may just skip the interface). In such a case, you may define methods that directly take or return entity objects.
To avoid confusion with regular use-cases, we recommend to add the `Internal` suffix to the type name leading to `Uc«Operation»«BusinessObject»Internal[Impl]`.

== Injection issues
Technically, now you have two implementations of your use-case:

* the direct implementation of the use-case (`Uc*Impl`)
* the component facade implementation (`«Component»Impl`)

When injecting a use-case interface this could cause ambiguities.
This is addressed as following:

* In the component facade implementation (`«Component»Impl`) spring is smart enough to resolve the ambiguity as it assumes that a spring bean never wants to inject itself (it can already be an access via `this`).
Therefore, only the proper use-case implementation remains as a candidate and injection works as expected.
* In all other places, simply always inject the component facade interface instead of the use-case.

In case you might have the lucky occasion to hit this nice exception:
```
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'uc...Impl': Bean with name 'uc...Impl' has been injected into other beans [...Impl] in its raw version as part of a circular reference, but has eventually been wrapped. This means that said other beans do not use the final version of the bean. This is often the result of over-eager type matching - consider using 'getBeanNamesOfType' with the 'allowEagerInit' flag turned off, for example.
```

To get rid of such an error you need to annotate your according implementation also with `@Lazy` in addition to `@Named`.
