= Access-Control
Access-Control is a central and important aspect of link:guide-security.asciidoc[Security]. It consists of two major aspects:

* xref:Authentication[] (Who tries to access?)
* xref:Authorization[] (Is the one accessing allowed to do what he wants to do?)

== Authentication
Definition:

> Authentication is the verification that somebody interacting with the system is the actual subject for whom he claims to be.

The one authenticated is properly called _subject_ or http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Principal.html[_principal_]. However, for simplicity we use the common term _user_ even though it may not be a human (e.g. in case of a service call from an external system).

To prove his authenticity the user provides some secret called _credentials_. The most simple form of credentials is a password.

NOTE: Please never implement your own authentication mechanism or credential store. You have to be aware of implicit demands such as salting and hashing credentials, password life-cycle with recovery, expiry, and renewal including email notification confirmation tokens, central password policies, etc. This is the domain of access managers and identity management systems. In a business context you will typically already find a system for this purpose that you have to integrate (e.g. via LDAP). Otherwise you should consider establishing such a system e.g. using http://keycloak.org[keycloak].

We use https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[spring-security] as a framework for authentication purposes. 

Therefore you need to provide an implementation of https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/WebSecurityConfigurer.html[WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter]:
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class MyWebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

  @Inject
  private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;
  ...
  public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.userDetailsService(this.userDetailsService)
        .authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated().and()
        ...
  }
}
----

As you can see spring-security offers a fluent API for easy configuration. You can simply add invocations like `formLogin().loginPage("/public/login")` or `httpBasic().realmName("MyApp")`. Also link:guide-security.asciidoc[CSRF] protection can be configured by invoking `csrf()`.
For further details see https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html/jc.html#jc-httpsecurity[spring Java-config for HTTP security].

Further, you need to provide an implementation of the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/UserDetailsService.html[UserDetailsService] interface.
A good starting point comes with our application template.

=== Preserve original request anchors after form login redirect
Spring Security will automatically redirect any unauthorized access to the defined login-page. After successful login, the user will be redirected to the original requested URL. The only pitfall is, that anchors in the request URL will not be transmitted to server and thus cannot be restored after successful login. Therefore the `devon4j-security` module provides the `RetainAnchorFilter`, which is able to inject javascript code to the source page and to the target page of any redirection. Using javascript this filter is able to retrieve the requested anchors and store them into a cookie. Heading the target URL this cookie will be used to restore the original anchors again.

To enable this mechanism you have to integrate the `RetainAnchorFilter` as follows:
First, declare the filter with 

* `storeUrlPattern`: an regular expression matching the URL, where anchors should be stored
* `restoreUrlPattern`: an regular expression matching the URL, where anchors should be restored
* `cookieName`: the name of the cookie to save the anchors in the intermediate time

You can easily configure this as code in your `WebSecurityConfig` as following:

[source,java]
----
RetainAnchorFilter filter = new RetainAnchorFilter();
filter.setStoreUrlPattern("http://[^/]+/[^/]+/login.*");
filter.setRestoreUrlPattern("http://[^/]+/[^/]+/.*");
filter.setCookieName("TARGETANCHOR");
http.addFilterBefore(filter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
----

=== Users vs. Systems
If we are talking about authentication we have to distinguish two forms of principals:

* human users
* autonomous systems

While e.g. a Kerberos/SPNEGO Single-Sign-On makes sense for human users it is pointless for authenticating autonomous systems. So always keep this in mind when you design your authentication mechanisms and separate access for human users from access for systems.

=== Mixed Authentication

In rare cases you might need to mix multiple authentication mechanisms (form based, basic-auth, SAMLv2, OAuth, etc.) within the same app (for different URLs). For KISS this should be avoided where possible. However, when needed, you can find a solution  
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#multiple-httpsecurity[here]. 

== Authorization

**Definition:**

> Authorization is the verification that an authenticated user is allowed to perform the operation he intends to invoke.

=== Clarification of terms

For clarification we also want to give a common understanding of related terms that have no unique definition and consistent usage in the wild.

.Security terms related to authorization
[options="header", cols="15%,85%"]
|=======================
|*Term*|*Meaning and comment*
|Permission|A permission is an object that allows a principal to perform an operation in the system. This permission can be _granted_ (give) or _revoked_ (taken away). Sometimes people also use the term _right_ what is actually wrong as a right (such as the right to be free) can not be revoked.
|Group|We use the term group in this context for an object that contains permissions. A group may also contain other groups. Then the group represents the set of all recursively contained permissions.
|Role|We consider a role as a specific form of group that also contains permissions. A role identifies a specific function of a principal. A user can act in a role.

For simple scenarios a principal has a single role associated. In more complex situations a principal can have multiple roles but has only one active role at a time that he can choose out of his assigned roles. For KISS it is sometimes sufficient to avoid this by creating multiple accounts for the few users with multiple roles. Otherwise at least avoid switching roles at run-time in clients as this may cause problems with related states. Simply restart the client with the new role as parameter in case the user wants to switch his role.
| Access Control | Any permission, group, role, etc., which declares a control for access management.
|=======================

=== Suggestions on the access model
For the access model we give the following suggestions:

* Each Access Control (permission, group, role, ...) is uniquely identified by a human readable string.
* We create a unique permission for each use-case.
* We define groups that combine permissions to typical and useful sets for the users.
* We define roles as specific groups as required by our business demands.
* We allow to associate users with a list of Access Controls.
* For authorization of an implemented use case we determine the required permission. Furthermore, we determine the current user and verify that the required permission is contained in the tree spanned by all his associated Access Controls. If the user does not have the permission we throw a security exception and thus abort the operation and transaction.
* We avoid negative permissions, that is a user has no permission by default and only those granted to him explicitly give him additional permission for specific things. Permissions granted can not be reduced by other permissions.
* Technically we consider permissions as a secret of the application. Administrators shall not fiddle with individual permissions but grant them via groups. So the access management provides a list of strings identifying the Access Controls of a user. The individual application itself contains these Access Controls in a structured way, whereas each group forms a permission tree.

=== Naming conventions
As stated above each Access Control is uniquely identified by a human readable string. This string should follow the naming convention: 
```
«app-id».«local-name»
```
For Access Control Permissions the `«local-name»` again follows the convention:
```
«verb»«object»
```
The segments are defined by the following table:

.Segments of Access Control Permission ID
[options="header"]
|=============================================
|*Segment* | *Description* | *Example*
|«app-id»|Is a unqiue technical but human readable string of the application (or microservice). It shall not contain special characters and especially no dot or whitespace. We recommend to use `lower-train-case-ascii-syntax`. The identity and access management should be organized on enterprise level rather than application level. Therefore permissions of different apps might easily clash (e.g. two apps might both define a group `ReadMasterData` but some user shall get this group for only one of these two apps). Using the `«app-id».` prefix is a simple but powerful namespacing concept that allows you to scale and grow. You may also reserve specific «app-id»s for cross-cutting concerns that do not actually reflect a single app e.g to grant access to a geographic region. |`shop`
|«verb»|The action that is to be performed on «object». We use `Find` for searching and reading data. `Save` shall be used both for create and update. Only if you really have demands to separate these two you may use `Create` in addition to `Save`. Finally, `Delete` is used for deletions. For non CRUD actions you are free to use additional verbs such as `Approve` or `Reject`.|`Find`
|«object»|The affected object or entity. Shall be named according to your data-model|`Product`
|=============================================

So as an example `shop.FindProduct` will reflect the permission to search and retrieve a `Product` in the `shop` application. The group `shop.ReadMasterData` may combine all permissions to read master-data from the `shop`. However, also a group `shop.Admin` may exist for the `Admin` role of the `shop` application. Here the `«local-name»` is `Admin` that does not follow the `«verb»«object»` schema.

=== devon4j-security

The devonfw provides a ready to use module `devon4j-security` that is based on http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[spring-security] and makes your life a lot easier.

.devon4j Security Model
image::images/Security-AccessControl.png["access-control", width="450", link="images/Security-AccessControl.png"]

The diagram shows the model of `devon4j-security` that separates two different aspects:

* The _Indentity- and Access-Management_ is provided by according products and typically already available in the enterprise landscape (e.g. an active directory). It provides a hierarchy of _primary access control objects_ (roles and groups) of a user. An administrator can grant and revoke permissions (indirectly) via this way.
* The application security defines a hierarchy of _secondary access control objects_ (groups and permissions). This is done by configuration owned by the application (see following section). The "API" is defined by the IDs of the primary access control objects that will be referenced from the _Indentity- and Access-Management_.

=== Access Control Config
In your application simply extend `AccessControlConfig` to configure your access control objects as code and reference it from your use-cases. An example config may look like this:
[source,java]
----
@Named
public class ApplicationAccessControlConfig extends AccessControlConfig {

  public static final String APP_ID = "MyApp";

  private static final String PREFIX = APP_ID + ".";

  public static final String PERMISSION_FIND_OFFER = PREFIX + "FindOffer";

  public static final String PERMISSION_SAVE_OFFER = PREFIX + "SaveOffer";

  public static final String PERMISSION_DELETE_OFFER = PREFIX + "DeleteOffer";

  public static final String PERMISSION_FIND_PRODUCT = PREFIX + "FindProduct";

  public static final String PERMISSION_SAVE_PRODUCT = PREFIX + "SaveProduct";

  public static final String PERMISSION_DELETE_PRODUCT = PREFIX + "DeleteProduct";

  public static final String GROUP_READ_MASTER_DATA = PREFIX + "ReadMasterData";

  public static final String GROUP_MANAGER = PREFIX + "Manager";

  public static final String GROUP_ADMIN = PREFIX + "Admin";

  public ApplicationAccessControlConfig() {

    super();
    AccessControlGroup readMasterData = group(GROUP_READ_MASTER_DATA, PERMISSION_FIND_OFFER, PERMISSION_FIND_PRODUCT);
    AccessControlGroup manager = group(GROUP_MANAGER, readMasterData, PERMISSION_SAVE_OFFER, PERMISSION_SAVE_PRODUCT);
    AccessControlGroup admin = group(GROUP_ADMIN, manager, PERMISSION_DELETE_OFFER, PERMISSION_DELETE_PRODUCT);
  }
}
----

=== Configuration on Java Method level
In your use-case you can now reference a permission like this:
[source,java]
----
@Named
public class UcSafeOfferImpl extends ApplicationUc implements UcSafeOffer {

  @Override
  @RolesAllowed(ApplicationAccessControlConfig.PERMISSION_SAVE_OFFER)
  public OfferEto save(OfferEto offer) { ... }
  ...
}
----

=== Check Data-Permissions
See link:guide-data-permission.asciidoc[data permissions]

=== Access Control Schema (deprecated)
The `access-control-schema.xml` approach is deprecated. The documentation can still be found in link:guide-access-control-schema.asciidoc[access control schema].
