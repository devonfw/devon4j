= Creating a new application

== Running the archetype

In order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the maven archetype functionality.

To create a new application, you should have installed devonfw IDE.
You can choose between 2 alternatives, create it from command line or, in more visual manner, within eclipse.

=== From command Line
To create a new devon4j application from command line, you can simply run the following command:

[source,bash]
---- 
devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp
---- 

For low-level creation you can also manually call this command: 

[source,bash]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=3.1.0 -DarchetypeGroupId=com.devonfw.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=devon4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.application -DartifactId=sampleapp -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.devonfw.application.sampleapp 
---- 

Further providing additional properties (using `-D` parameter) you can customize the generated app:

.Options for app template
[options="header"]
|=======================
|*property*      |*comment*                                                                                           |*example*
|`dbType`        |Choose the type of RDBMS to use (`hana`, `oracle`, `mssql`, `postgresql`, `mariadb`, `mysql`, etc.) |`-DdbTpye=postgresql`
|`batch`         |Option to add an `batch` module                                                                     |`-Dbatch=batch`
|`earProjectName`|Option to add an EAR module with the given name                                                     |`-DearProjectName=ear`
|=======================

=== From Eclipse
 After that, you should follow this Eclipse steps to create your application:

* Create a new Maven Project.
* Choose the devon4j-template-server archetype, just like the image.

image::images/eclipse-m2e-create-devon4j-project.png["Select archetype",scaledwidth="80%",align="center"]

* Fill the Group Id, Artifact Id, Version and Package for your project.
If you want to add an EAR generation mechanism to your project, you should fill the property earProjectName with the value Artifact Id + "-ear". For example, "sampleapp-ear". If you only want WAR generation, you can remove the property earProjectName.

* Finish the Eclipse assistant and you are ready to start your project.

== What is generated

The application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:

* `api`: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transferobjects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.
* `core`: maven module containing the core of the application.
* `batch`: optional module for link:guide-batch-layer.asciidoc[batch](es)
* `server`: module that bundles the entire app (`core` with optional `batch`) as a WAR file.
* `ear`: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.

The toplevel `pom.xml` of the generated project has the following features:

* Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.
* Modules definition for the modules (described above)
* Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.
* Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration
* Profiles for link:guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]

== Make jar not war

By default server module will bundle entire app as WAR file. To create bootified jar instead of war user needs to make below changes in server/pom.xml`

* In server/pom.xml update <packaging>war</packaging> to <packaging>jar</packaging> .
* once pom.xml is updated execute maven build command such as mvn clean install.
* Check server/target folder user should see ${projectname}-server-bootified.jar file created.

== How to run project 

=== Run Project from IDE :

To run project from ide user needs to launch SpringBootApp.java as java class.

=== Run Project using bootified jar/war:

* To run project using bootified jar/war , navigate to server module target folder. In target folder user will get ${projectname}-server-bootified.war or ${projectname}-bootified.jar file. 
* Launch this bootified jar/war with command java -jar ${projectname}-server-bootified.war
