= MariaDB

This section gives guidance and hints for those who use https://mariadb.org/[MariaDB] as link:guide-database.asciidoc#rdbms[RDBMS].

== Driver
MariaDB is fully open-source. The driver is therefore available in maven central.
Your dependency for the driver should look as following:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>${mariadb.driver.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
Of course the version (`${mariadb.driver.version}`) needs to be adopted to your needs (MariaDB installtion in production and JDK version, e.g. `2.5.1`).
For an overview of available driver versions see https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mariadb.jdbc/mariadb-java-client[here].
