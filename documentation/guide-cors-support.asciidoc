= CORS support

When you are developing Javascript client and server application separately, you have to deal with cross domain issues. We have to request from a origin domain distinct to target domain and browser does not allow this. 

So , we need to prepare server side to accept request from other domains. We need to cover the following points:

* Accept request from other domains.

* Accept devonfw used headers like `X-CSRF-TOKEN` or `correlationId.`

* Be prepared to receive secured request (cookies).

It is important to note that if you are using security in your request (sending cookies) you have to set  `withCredentials` flag to `true` in your client side request and deal with special IE8 characteristics.

== Configuring CORS support

On the server side we have defined a new filter in Spring security chain filters to support CORS and we have configured devonfw security chain filter to use it.

You only have to change `CORSDisabled` property value in `application-default.properties` properties file.
