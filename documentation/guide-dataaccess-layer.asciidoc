= Data-Access Layer

The data-access layer is responsible for all outgoing connections to access and process data. This is mainly about accessing data from a persistent data-store but also about invoking external services.

== Database

You need to make your choice for a database. Options are documented https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide/blob/master/general/db/guide-database.asciidoc[here].

The classical approach is to use a Relational Database Management System (RDMS). In such a case, we strongly recommend to follow our link:guide-jpa.asciidoc[JPA Guide]. Some NoSQL databases are supported by https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[spring-data] so you can consider the link:guide-repository.asciidoc[repository guide].
