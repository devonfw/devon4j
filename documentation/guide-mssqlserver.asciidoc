= MS-SQL-Server

This section gives guidance and hints for those who use https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/[Microsoft SQL Server] as link:guide-database.asciidoc#rdbms[RDBMS].

== Driver
Microsoft SQL Server is a commercial and professional product.
However, the JDBC driver is MIT licensed and available in Maven Central what makes it easy to integrate.
Your dependency for the driver should look as following:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>mssql-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>${mssqlserver.driver.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
Of course the version (`${mssqlserver.driver.version}`) needs to be adopted to your needs (SQL Server installtion in production and JDK version, e.g. `7.4.1.jre8`).
For an overview of available driver versions see https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc[here].
