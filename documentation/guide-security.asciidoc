= Security
//Fixed Typo
Security is todays most important cross-cutting concern of an application and an enterprise IT-landscape. We seriously care about security and give you detailed guides to prevent pitfalls, vulnerabilities, and other disasters. While many mistakes can be avoided by following our guidelines you still have to consider security and think about it in your design and implementation. The security guide will not only automatically prevent you from any harm, but will provide you hints and best practices already used in different software products.

An important aspect of security is proper authentication and authorization as described in link:guide-access-control.asciidoc[access-control]. In the following we discuss about potential vulnerabilities and protection to prevent them.

== Vulnerabilities and Protection
Independent from classical authentication and authorization mechanisms there are many common pitfalls that can lead to vulnerabilities and security issues in your application such as XSS, CSRF, SQL-injection, log-forging, etc. A good source of information about this is the https://www.owasp.org[OWASP].
We address these common threats individually in _security_ sections of our technological guides as a concrete solution to prevent an attack typically depends on the according technology. The following table illustrates common threats and contains links to the solutions and protection-mechanisms provided by the devonfw:

== Tools
=== Dependency Check
To address https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities[A9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities] we integrated https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check[OWASP dependency check] into the devonfw maven build. If you build an devonfw application (sample or any app created from our link:tutorial-newapp.asciidoc[app-template]) you can activate dependency check with the `security` profile:
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn clean install -P security
---- 
This does not run by default as it causes a huge overhead for the build performance. However , consider to build this in your CI at least nightly.
After the dependency check is performed , you will find the results in `target/dependency-check-report.html` of each module. The report will also always be generated when the site is build (`mvn site`).

=== Penetration Testing
For penetration testing (testing for vulnerabilities) of your web application, we recommend the following tools:

* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project[ZAP] (OWASP Zed Attack Proxy Project)
* http://sqlmap.org/[sqlmap] (or https://github.com/PaulSec/HQLmap[HQLmap])
* https://nmap.org/[nmap]
* See the marvellous presentation https://www.Christian-Schneider.net/downloads/JAX-Talk-Werkzeugkasten-Security-Professional.pdf[Toolbox of a security professional] from https://www.Christian-Schneider.net[Christian Schneider].
