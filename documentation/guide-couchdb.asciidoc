= CouchDB

This section is the place to share experience for those who use https://couchdb.apache.org/[CouchDB] as link:guide-database.asciidoc#nosql[NoSQL database].

== Attention
NOTE: In devonfw we do not properly support this. You are free to use this database but do not expect advanced integration, CobiGen templates, etc.

== Driver
Please be aware that there is not a regular JDBC driver in case you are using Java (devon4j).
For driver options see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Java[here].
