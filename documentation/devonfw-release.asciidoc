= Creating a Release

This page documents how to create and publish a release of devon4j.

For each release there is a https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/milestones[milestone] that contains an issue for creating the release itself (the github issue of that issue is referred as `«issue»`). The release version is referred as «x.y.z».

== Releasing the code
To release the code follow these steps.

* Create a clean clone of the repository:
+
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j.git
+
* In case you want to build a (bug fix) release from a different branch, switch to that branch:
+
[source,bash]
git checkout -b develop-«x.y» origin/develop-«x.y»
+
* Ensure your branch is up-to-date:
+
[source,bash]
git pull
+
* Ensure that the result is what you want to release (`mvn clean install`).
* Bump the release version by removing the `-SNAPSHOT` from `devon4j.version` property in top-level `pom.xml`.
* Create an annotated tag for your release:
+
[source,bash]
git tag -a release/x.y.z -m "#«issue»: tagged x.y.z"
+
e.g For release 2.5.0 the command would look like
+
[source,bash]
git tag -a release/2.5.0 -m "#618: tagged 2.5.0" 
+ 
where #618 is the issue number created for release itself under release milestone.
You can confirm if the tag is created by listing out the tags with the following command
+
```
git tag
```

=== Configure OSSRH
For publishing artifacts to OSSRH, we need an OSSRH account with necessary rights for publishing and managing staging repositories. And configure this account in devonfw distribution to create connection and deploy to OSSRH.

* If you do not already have an account on OSSRH, create an account on the link below
https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa
* You need manager access to deploy artifacts to OSSRH. For same contact devonfw administrators for OSSRH.
* Open file `conf/.m2/setting.xml` in your devon distribution (devon-ide) and add a new server with following details
+
```xml
<server>
   <id>ossrh</id>
   <username>«ossrh_username»</username>
   <password>«ossrh_password»</password>
</server>
```
Here `«ossrh_username»` and `«ossrh_password»` are the account details used to login into OSSRH and should have rights to publish artifacts to OSSRH for `groupId` name `com.devonfw` (and its children).
Please use http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[password encryption] and prevent
storing passwords in plain text.
The id `ossrh` points to the OSSRH repository for snaphost and release declared in the  `<distributionManagement>` section of the `devon4j/pom.xml`.
* Optionally you may want to explicitly define PGP key via the associated email-address:
+
```xml
<profile>
  <id>devon.ossrh</id>
  <activation>
    <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
  </activation>
  <properties>
    <gpg.keyname>your.email@address.com</gpg.keyname>
  </properties>
</profile>
```

=== Configure PGP
Artifacts should be PGP signed before they can be deployed to OSSRH. Artifacts can be signed either by using command line tool GnuPG or GUI based tool Gpg4win Kleopetra (preferred). Follow the steps below to sign artifacts using either of the two tools.

* Download tools
GnuPg - https://www.gnupg.org/download/
gpg4win - https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html
* Installation
Installation is self explanatory for GnuPG and gpg4win. To verify installation of GnuPg, open windows command line and run "gpg --version or gpg2 --version"
* Generate PGP key pair for signing artifacts.

[NOTE]
====
Remember the passphrase set for PGP keys as it will be used later for authentication during signing of artifacts by maven.
==== 
Using GnuPg follow either of the link below

http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html#generating-a-key-pair

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE3FVty3NgE&feature=youtu.be

Using Kleopetra follow link below

https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/02/21/pgp-tutorial-for-windows-kleopatra-gpg4win/

Exporting PGP key to public key-server

Using GnuPg - http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html#distributing-your-public-key

Using Kleopetra, click on the certificate entry you want to publish to OpenPGP certificate servers and select File > Publish on Server as shown below. These instructions are as per Kleopatra 3.0.1-gpg4win-3.0.2, for latest versions there might be some variation.

=== Deploy to OSSRH
* Go to the root of devon4j project and run following command. Make sure there are no spaces between comma separated profiles.
+
[source,bash]
mvn clean deploy -P deploy
+
* A pop will appear asking for passphrase for PGP key. Enter the passphrase and press "OK".

[NOTE]
====
If you face the error below, contact one of the people who have access to the repository for access rights.

* Open https://oss.sonatype.org/[OSSRH], login and open staging repositories.
* Find your deployment repository as `comdevonfw-NNNN` and check its `Content`.
* Then click on `Close` to close the repository and wait a minute.
* Refresh the repository and copy the URL.
* Create a vote for the release and paste the URL of the staging repository.
* After the vote has passed with success go back to OSSRH and and click on `Release` to publish the release and stage to maven central.
* Edit the top-level `pom.xml` and change `devon4j.version` property to the next planned release version including the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix.
* Commit and push the changes:
+
[source,bash]
git commit -m "#«issue»: open next snapshot version"
git push
+
* In case you build the release from a branch other that `develop` ensure to follow the next steps. Otherwise you are done here and can continue to the next section. To merge the changes (bug fixes) onto develop do:
+
[source,bash]
git checkout develop
git merge develop-«x.y»
+
* You most probably will have a conflict in the top-level `pom.xml`. Then resolve this conflict. In any case edit this `pom.xml` and ensure that it is still pointing to the latest planned `SNAPSHOT` for the `develop` branch.
* If there are local changes to the top-level `pom.xml`, commit them:
+
[source,bash]
git commit -m "#«issue»: open next snapshot version"
+
* Push the changes of your `develop` branch:
+
[source,bash]
git push

== Releasing the documentation

* Initially and only once you have to create a local checkout of the github pages and of the wiki repository connected to the https://github.com/devonfw-wiki/devon4j/wiki/[community wiki]:
+
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw.github.io.git
git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j.wiki.git
cd devon4j.wiki
git remote add source https://github.com/devonfw-wiki/devon4j.wiki.git
+
* Pull from `origin` as well as from `source`:
+
[source,bash]
git pull origin
git pull source
+
* Carefully review all changes that have been done on the forge wiki. Potentially reject changes if necessary.
* When you are complete push your changes:
+
[source,bash]
git push origin
+
* Edit the `pom.xml` and change `version` to bump it to the release version (remove the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix).
* Commit the changes:
+
[source,bash]
git commit -m "#«issue»: bumped release version «x.y.z»"
* Create an annotated tag for your release:
+
[source,bash]
git tag -a release/x.y.z -m "#«issue»: tagged «x.y.z»"
+
* Build and deploy the documentation PDF from the cloned wiki repository via
+
[source,bash]
mvn clean deploy -P oss
+
* Open https://oss.sonatype.org/[OSSRH], login and open staging repositories.
* Find your deployment repository as `comdevonfw-NNNN` and check its `Content`
* Only proceed if the PDF is sane (otherwise check what failed and restart)
* Then click on `Close` to close the repository and wait a minute.
* Refresh the repository.
* Click on `Release` to publish the release and stage to maven central.
* Edit the top-level `pom.xml` and change `version` property to the next planned release version including the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix.
* Commit and push the changes:
+
[source,bash]
git commit -m "#«issue»: open next snapshot version"
git push --tags
+
* Also push the changes back to the community wiki:
+
[source,bash]
git push source master
+
* Create a new folder for your version in your checkout of https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw.github.io/tree/master/devon4j[devonfw.github.io/devon4j] (as `«x.y.z»`).
* Copy the just generated `devon4j-doc.pdf` into the new release version folder.
* Copy the `index.html` from the previous release to the new release version folder.
* Edit the new copy of `index.html` and replace all occurrences of the version to the new release as well as the release date.
* Generate the maven site from the `devon4j` release checkout (see xref:releasing-the-core[code release]):
+
[source,bash]
mvn site
mvn site:deploy
+
* Review that the maven site is intact and copy it to the new release version folder (from `devon4j/target/devon4j/maven` to `devonfw.github.io/devon4j/«x.y.z»/maven`).
* Update the link in the `devon4j/index.html` to the latest stable documentation.
* Add, commit and push the new release version folder.
+
[source,bash]
git add «x.y.z»
git commit -m "devonfw/devon4j#«issue»: released documentation"
git push


== Finalize the Release

* Close the issue of the release.
* Close the milestone of the release (if necessary correct the release date).
* Ensure that the new release is available in maven central.
* Write an announcement for the new release.
