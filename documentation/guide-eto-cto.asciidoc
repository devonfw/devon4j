== ETO

For each link:guide-jpa.asciidoc#entity[persistent entity] `«BusinessObject»Entity` we create or generate a corresponding _entity transfer object_ (ETO) named `«BusinessObject»Eto`. It has the same properties except for relations.

In order to centralize the properties (getters and setters with their javadoc) we create a common interface `«BusinessObject»` implemented both by the entity and its ETO. This also gives us compile-time safety that
link:guide-beanmapping.asciidoc[bean-mapper] can properly map all properties between entity and ETO.

== CTO

WARNING: Hey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won't be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page https://devonfw.com/docs/java/current/[here].
If we need to pass an entity with its relation(s) we create a corresponding _composite transfer object_ (CTO) named `«BusinessObject»«Subset»Cto` that only contains other transfer-objects or collections of them. Here `«Subset»` is empty for the canonical CTO that holds the ETO together with all its relations.
This is what can be generated automatically with https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen[CobiGen].
However, be careful to generate CTOs without thinking and considering design.
If there are no relations at all a CTO is pointless and shall be omitted.
However, if there are multiple relations you typically need  multiple CTOs for the same `«BusinessObject»` that define different subsets of the related data.
These will typically be designed and implemented by hand.
E.g. you may have `CustomerWithAddressCto` and `CustomerWithContractCto`. Most CTOs correspond to a specific `«BusinessObject»` and therefore contain a `«BusinessObject»Eto`. Such CTOs should inherit from `MasterCto`.

This pattern with entities, ETOs and CTOs is illustrated by the following UML diagram from our sample application.
